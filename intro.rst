Introduction
============

Comimant is a fully customisable, open source platform for creating intranet systems.

Comimant is still a work in progress, but will be aiming to include features such 
as: a customisable widget system, file browsers for network shares, custom applications, 
and a modular plugin system, all delivered through the use of a service worker for
speed.

The platform is available in two packages: Comimant and Comimant Server.

Comimant is the core package, and will serve the web interface, authorization, and 
most other parts of the platform.

Comimant Server communicates with Comimant and allows information such as disk usage, 
files, and active users to be displayed by Comimant.

For status on what has been implemented already, see :doc:`/todo`.
